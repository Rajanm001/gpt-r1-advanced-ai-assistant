## Orchestration Workflow

### Enhanced 6-Step Agentic Process

2. **ANALYZE** - Enhanced query analysis with orchestration insights
3. **SEARCH** - Advanced information gathering with tool coordination
4. **SYNTHESIZE** - Sophisticated information integration
5. **VALIDATE** - Comprehensive quality validation
6. **RESPOND** - Enhanced response generation

### Tool Selection Algorithm

```python
def _select_best_tool(self, request: ToolRequest) -> Optional[BaseTool]:
    """
    Intelligent tool selection based on:
    - Tool confidence scoring (can_handle method)
    - Historical performance metrics
    - Tool availability and load balancing
    """
    best_tool = None
    best_score = 0.0
    
    for tool in self.tools.values():
        if tool.is_available:
            confidence_score = tool.can_handle(request)
            performance_modifier = tool.success_rate * 0.1
            total_score = confidence_score + performance_modifier
            
            if total_score > best_score:
                best_score = total_score
                best_tool = tool
    
    return best_tool
```

### Dependency Management

The orchestrator handles complex tool dependencies:

- **Sequential Execution**: Tools execute in dependency order
- **Parallel Processing**: Independent tools run concurrently
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when tools fail
- **Result Propagation**: Output from one tool feeds into dependent tools

## Advanced Features

### 1. Performance Analytics

```python
class PerformanceStats:
    - total_executions: int
    - success_rate: float  
    - average_execution_time: float
    - average_confidence: float
```

### 2. Quality Assurance

- **Multi-layered Validation**: Each tool result is validated
- **Confidence Aggregation**: Weighted confidence scoring across tools
- **Cross-tool Verification**: Results verified against multiple sources

### 3. Orchestration Metadata

```python
orchestration_metadata = {
    "tool_plan": [...],
    "coordination_strategy": "sequential_with_dependency_management", 
    "performance_optimization": "enabled"
}
```

### 4. Real-time Monitoring

- **Execution Tracking**: Real-time workflow progress
- **Performance Metrics**: Tool-by-tool performance analysis
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and reporting

## API Integration

### Enhanced Agentic Service

The `AdvancedAgenticService` now includes orchestration:

```python
class AdvancedAgenticService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rag_service = RAGService()
        self.orchestrator = AdvancedToolOrchestrator()  # NEW
        self.workflow_history = []
    
    async def execute_agentic_workflow(self, user_query: str, conversation_history: List[Dict] = None):
        # Step 1: ORCHESTRATE - Multi-Tool Workflow
        orchestrate_step = await self._step_orchestrate_tools(user_query, conversation_history)
        
        # Enhanced steps with orchestration data...
```

### Tool Orchestration Step

```python
async def _step_orchestrate_tools(self, user_query: str, conversation_history: List[Dict] = None):
    """Multi-tool orchestration for sophisticated workflow planning"""
    
    # Execute multi-tool orchestration
    orchestration_result = await self.orchestrator.orchestrate_workflow(user_query, context)
    
    return {
        "orchestration_successful": True,
        "tools_orchestrated": result["tools_orchestrated"], 
        "final_result": result["final_result"],
        "quality_validation": result["quality_validation"],
        "tool_breakdown": result["tool_breakdown"]
    }
```

## Configuration and Customization

### Tool Registration

```python
def _initialize_tools(self):
    """Register and initialize all available tools"""
    tools = [
        WebSearchTool(),
        AnalysisTool(), 
        SynthesisTool(),
        ValidationTool()
    ]
    
    for tool in tools:
        self.tools[tool.name] = tool
        self.performance_stats[tool.name] = {...}
```

### Custom Tool Development

Extend `BaseTool` to create custom tools:

```python
class CustomTool(BaseTool):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("CustomTool", ToolType.CUSTOM)
    
    async def execute(self, input_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> ToolResult:
        # Custom tool implementation
        pass
    
    def can_handle(self, request: ToolRequest) -> float:
        # Confidence scoring logic
        pass
```
